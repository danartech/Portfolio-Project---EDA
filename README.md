# MySQL Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Project Description

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of company layoffs using MySQL. The main goal was to uncover insights and trends related to layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2023.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Ensured the dataset was free from inconsistencies and prepared it for analysis.
   - Addressed any missing or incorrect data points.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - **Initial Analysis**: Analyzed basic statistics such as the maximum number of layoffs in a single event and the highest percentage of layoffs in companies.
   - **Company Analysis**: Identified companies with significant layoffs and examined specific instances where entire companies went under.
   - **Industry and Country Analysis**: Investigated which industries and countries were most affected by layoffs.
   - **Time Series Analysis**: Conducted a time series analysis to observe trends in layoffs over time, including monthly and yearly breakdowns.
   - **Rolling Sum of Layoffs**: Calculated a rolling sum of layoffs to visualize the cumulative impact over time.
   - **Ranking Layoffs by Year**: Ranked companies by the number of layoffs per year to identify the hardest-hit companies annually.

### Key Findings:

- Significant layoffs occurred in major companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.
- Certain industries, such as retail and consumer services, were more affected by layoffs, especially during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The United States had the highest number of layoffs reported in the dataset.
- The number of layoffs increased dramatically from 2020 to 2023, with 2022 being particularly severe.

### Tools and Techniques Used:

- **MySQL**: For data querying and analysis.
- **Window Functions**: To calculate rolling sums and rank companies by layoffs.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: To summarize data by company, industry, country, and time period.

This project not only provided valuable insights into the impact of layoffs but also demonstrated the power of SQL for data analysis. Feel free to explore the code and queries used in this analysis in the repository.
